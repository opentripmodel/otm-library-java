/**
 * <p>
 * {@code Events} - like {@code actions} - model dynamic entities that couple various static entities at a certain moment in time. Events are used for either real-time updates or updates on earlier provided data. Notice that in both event types these are updates on earlier provided data, whereas actions are usually used together with the entities they dynamically couple.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are various kinds of events that fall into the two earlier mentioned kinds.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Real-time updates:</b>
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>The <b>LocationUpdateEvent</b> that provides location data received from some GPS.</li>
 *      <li>The <b>SensorUpdateEvent</b> that provides sensor value updates (such as temperature or speed measurements) received from a sensor.</li>
 *      <li>The <b>StartMovingEvent, StopMovingEvent, StartEngineEvent, StopEngineEvent</b> that indicate events provided by Fleet Management Systems.</li>
 *  </ul>
 * <b>Both real-time and projected/realized events</b>
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>The <b>EmissionEvent</b> that contains information about how much emission has been produced during a move / on a trip / per consignment. Can be provided as an actual value, projected based on some calculation, or realized as measured by some sensor.</li>
 *      <li>The <b>FuelConsumedEvent</b> that contains information about how much fuel was consumed during a move / on a trip / per consignment. Can be provided as an actual value, projected based on some calculation, or realized as measured by some sensor.</li>
 *  </ul>
 *  <b>Updates on earlier provided data:</b>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The <b>UpdateEvent</b> that is used to update an earlier provided entity with new information. Note that only the changed data has to be provided.</li>
 *     <li>The <b>AssociationCreatedEvent</b> and <b>AssociationRemovedEvent</b> that allow for static entities to be coupled after the fact. Such as coupling a Vehicle to a Trip.</li>
 * </ul>
